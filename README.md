# MaristAir Cloud Project

## -- Introduction --
This project is a simple airline reservation web application to allow users to schedule flights at an airport. The goal of this project is to showcase a hybrid cloud environment using a real-world example most people have used.

The application webpage is meant to be deployed across any number of cloud providers. It is able to integrate with any configured database target, allowing for data flexibility between application instances. As well, this provides options to run the applications in different public clouds and source a private on-premises database or another database in the cloud depending on what the airport needs.

For example, two airport proivders can run the same code, but have them configured to target their own private database. Another example is a single airport running multiple instances of the app for load-balancing, and having each configured to target a single central database.

The application is created using:

    Python-flask front end
    One or more MYSQL databases on the backend
    Python MySQLdb library used to pass SQL information between the two over TCPIP.


The main functions available to an airport administrator are:

        Set a Database target and port
        Add Flight entries to the targeted DB
        List reservations users have made

A general user would then have access to:

        Creating an account
        Making a reservation

For demo purposes all functions are available, and privilege level is denoted on the homepage. Additionally, two cloud app instances and databases are pre-configured for testing purposes.


#### Project Objective
From the course: *The objective is to learn how the native cloud applications can be developed and deployed into the hybrid cloud environment. Each student needs to set up and configure a hybrid cloud environment(IBM Cloud + other cloudand local cloud environment)and run a cloud application that is built by him/herself.*

The application deploys two separate instances of the python flask webpage app 'MaristAir' on IBM Cloud and AWS, and show  each are configurable within the cloud to target independent databases, as well as operate off a single shared database.

This exemplifies a hybrid cloud environment since many webpages are deployed accross different providers, and are configurable to target other public or private databases. Scalability is also acheived as more cloud databases and webpages could be configured as needed as user demand grows.

The ideal use of this application for a single company would have many webpages deployed within multiple clouds and target a private database for security.

#### Connectivity

For this project, there are two public webpages & databases that were configured for testing purposes. Connectivity information is as follows:

- ***Local Cloud:***
IP = http://127.0.0.1:5000
Valid DBs = ['db', maristairdb1, maristairdb2]

- ***IBM Cloud:***
IP = 173.193.92.200:31356
Valid DBs =  [maristairdb1, maristairdb2]

- ***AWS ECS:***
IP = http://3.80.195.167:5000
Valid DBs = [maristairdb1, maristairdb2]


*Database Info*

The maristairdb1 and maristairdb2 are the hostnames for the public databases. If testing this project, please use one of these on port 3306 (note, they are the same domain). 

- maristairdb1.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- maristairdb2.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

The database 'db' is the name of the docker mysql5.7 image started in the same namespace as the local docker execution of my app using docker-compose. It is not available for public testing.



#### History
This project was originally developed as a proof-of-concept for a database course. The original intent was to interact on a localhost between the 127.0.0.1:5000 flask server and the local database instance using python's mysqldb libs. In order to configure the app for cloud deployment, three major changes were required:

- Change the MySQLDB database connection call to accept a configurable database IP and port
- Add in a webpage (changeDatabase) to allow an admin user to configure the database IP/port
- Change the html code to accept python-flask arguments passed based on the HOSTNAME of the cloud service, allowing for portability between providers. Ex: Links to Homepage should target the same cloud instance, not another IP or 127.0.0.1



## -- Dependencies --

1. **Configured MySQL Database**
  - Located in the 'db' folder are two configuration files:
      - MaristAirDBSQL.sql = initial table and user creation
      - MaristAir_Inserts.sql = populate tables with information on airlines, cities, options, and planes
  - A separate Database administrator would have to set this up outside of the application. This is because the app is supposed to target a customer database, which should be pre-built by them with whatever information that is relevant to their area (ex. Domestic-only airport vs International flights).

2. **Python3.6**
  - The application uses the python:3.6 image located within Dockerhub
  - Additional python dependencies are located in requirements.txt and include:
     - flask = the backbone of the application, creates the web interface
     - mysqlclient = the database interface libs to connect to a MySQL database

3. **Web Browser**
  - Interaction with the app, as well as initial setup on IBM Cloud and AWS require the use of a web browser.

4. **Docker**
  - Allows development of the python application in the local env to be pushed to Dockerhub. Both IBM and AWS will source this image: jboniello/maristair:1.0




## -- Deployment --

### *Local Environment*
The design was tested using the following setup:

        Windows 10 laptop
        Running VirtualBox + Vagrant using Ubuntu VM
        Docker to run a python 3.6 image
        Docker-compose also links to a docker mysql5.7 image to run a local database within the namespace called "db"

##### Docker commands
- docker build -t maristair:latest .
- docker tag maristair jboniello/maristair:1.0
- docker push jboniello/maristair:1.0

##### Local Database Config:
- mysql --host='127.0.0.1' --port=32000 -u root -p < MaristAirDBSQL.sql
- mysql --host='127.0.0.1' --port=32000 -u root -p < MaristAir_Inserts.sql



### *Cloud Environments*

*Cloud services used:*
- Github to store source code (you are here!)
- Dockerhub image tested in the local setup was pushed to repository: jboniello/maristair:1.0
- IBM Cloud using Kubernetes Service was deployed via CLI tools (ibmcloud / kubectl) as learned in this class.
- AWS container was deployed using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) using their webpage interface.
- AWS RDS services were also used to create 2 databases instances, since I need persistent databases for the demonstration.


#### IBM Deployment using Kubernetes:

Below are the commands used to deploy the docker image to IBM cloud and start the service using IBM Kubernetes. The ibmcloud and kubectl where pre-installed as part of the class (lab 5).

- ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r us-south -g Default

- ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster bnnrbbnd0cm3ttj81ivg   (Create this cluster on IBM's webpage)

- export KUBECONFIG=/root/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/bnnrbbnd0cm3ttj81ivg/kube-config-hou02-maristair_cluster.yml

- kubectl run maristairdeploy --image=docker.io/jboniello/maristair:1.0

- kubectl expose deployment/maristairdeploy --type=NodePort --name=maristairservice --port=80 --target-port=5000


- kubectl get services
 ```

```

External IP is accessed by the nodeport: http://173.193.92.200:31356
By default, the application is setup to use the database found on  maristairdb1.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306



#### AWS Delpoyment using ECS

- Create a default cluster: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/clusters
- Create a container: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/firstRun
    - Amazon makes it simple by selecting the "custom" option
    - Give the container a name, enter the dockerhub image 'jboniello/maristair:1.0" , and set port to 5000
- Give the container a VPC and configure network rules to allow all Inbound/OutBound connections (0.0.0.0/0)
- Screenshots of webpages are located in screenshot folder
- Run a task using the container, and get the IP and port (Screenshot = AWSrunningTaskContainer.PNG)


External IP is accessed by: IP = http://3.80.195.167:5000
By default, the application is setup to use the database found on  maristairdb1.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306


#### Database Config

The two cloud database instances were created using AWS RDS (relational database service). Creation is easy, as MySQL 5.7 is a selectable option.

The important configuration steps are: 
- Assign the name
- Select MySQL5.7
- Select other options like storage capacity
- Assign VPC to allow public routable IP configuration

Once initialized, a database admin can use the MySQL command line to initialize the database. The pre-configured databases for this project are shown below:

**maristairdb1**
-  mysql -u admin -p -h maristairdb1.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 < MaristAirDBSQL.sql
- mysql -u admin -p -h maristairdb1.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 < MaristAir_Inserts.sql

** maristairdb2**
- mysql -u admin -p -h maristairdb2.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 < MaristAirDBSQL.sql
- mysql -u admin -p -h maristairdb2.ced3raw81xcn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 < MaristAir_Inserts.sql
